# my_shell_scripts

This repository contains my automations.
My daily tasks or frequest tasks are handled by these scripts which are growing each day.

## Files
### reasy
This script creates react app and clears all boilerplate code and gives me ready to use react project. 

<code> reasy project_name </code>

### comp
This script is super helpful. Each time I required to create a file for coding 
I used to create a file then copy paste boilerplate from another file or sometimes code myself. 
Now, a single command does it. 
<code> comp filename.cpp </code>
